# PopDish Zurich

This is a simple prototype for the PopDish Zurich app with a Node.js backend and a React frontend.

## Development

### Backend

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
The server starts on port 3001.

### Frontend

Run the following commands from the **client** directory to install the
frontend dependencies (including Tailwind's PostCSS plugin) and start Vite:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend is served on port 5173.
